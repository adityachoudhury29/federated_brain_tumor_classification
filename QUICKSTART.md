# Federated Learning Quick Reference Guide

## 🎯 Quick Start

### On Server (Your Machine):
```bash
# 1. Find your IP address
hostname -I

# 2. Edit config.py - set SERVER_IP to your IP
nano config.py

# 3. Start server
python fl_server.py
```

### On Each Client Machine:
```bash
# 1. Copy files from server
scp aditya@server_ip:/path/model_architecture.py .
scp aditya@server_ip:/path/config.py .
scp aditya@server_ip:/path/fl_client.py .

# 2. Edit config.py
#    - Set SERVER_IP to server's IP
#    - Set CLIENT_DATA_DIR to your dataset path

# 3. Start client
python fl_client.py client_1
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Checklist

### In config.py - Server Machine:
- [ ] `SERVER_IP = '192.168.1.100'` ← Your server's actual IP
- [ ] `NUM_CLIENTS = 3` ← How many client machines you have
- [ ] `MIN_CLIENTS = 2` ← Minimum to start training
- [ ] `NUM_FL_ROUNDS = 10` ← Total federated rounds
- [ ] `NUM_LOCAL_EPOCHS = 5` ← Epochs per client per round

### In config.py - Client Machines:
- [ ] `SERVER_IP = '192.168.1.100'` ← Same as server's IP
- [ ] `CLIENT_DATA_DIR = '/path/to/your/data'` ← Where your dataset is

## 🔄 Training Flow

```
Round 1:
  Server → Sends global model → Client 1, Client 2, Client 3
  Client 1 → Trains 5 epochs on local data → Sends weights → Server
  Client 2 → Trains 5 epochs on local data → Sends weights → Server
  Client 3 → Trains 5 epochs on local data → Sends weights → Server
  Server → Averages all weights → Updates global model
  Server → Evaluates on validation set → Saves checkpoint

Round 2:
  (Repeat...)
```

## 🔍 Important Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `NUM_FL_ROUNDS` | 10 | Number of federated learning rounds |
| `NUM_LOCAL_EPOCHS` | 5 | Training epochs per client per round |
| `NUM_CLIENTS` | 3 | Expected number of clients |
| `MIN_CLIENTS` | 2 | Minimum clients needed to start |
| `BATCH_SIZE` | 32 | Batch size for training |
| `LEARNING_RATE` | 0.01 | Learning rate |
| `SERVER_PORT` | 8080 | Port for communication |
| `TIMEOUT` | 300 | Connection timeout (seconds) |

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Server won't start:
```bash
# Check if port is already in use
netstat -tulpn | grep 8080

# Kill process using port
sudo kill -9 <PID>
```

### Client can't connect:
```bash
# Test connectivity
ping server_ip
telnet server_ip 8080

# Check firewall
sudo ufw status
sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp
```

### Dataset not found:
- Check path in `config.py` → `CLIENT_DATA_DIR`
- Verify folder structure matches expected format
- Ensure folders are named exactly: `Training`, `Testing`, `glioma_tumor`, etc.

## 💡 Tips

1. **Always start server first**, then clients
2. **All machines must be on same network**
3. **Test with 1 client first** before adding more
4. **Keep datasets similar size** across clients for best results
5. **Monitor server logs** to track training progress
6. **Save checkpoints** are in `models/` directory
7. **Final model** is `models/final_global_model.pth`

---

## 🚀 Quick Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Find your IP
hostname -I

# Start server
python fl_server.py

# Start client
python fl_client.py client_1

# Copy files to client
scp model_architecture.py config.py fl_client.py user@client_ip:/path/

# Check if server is running
netstat -tulpn | grep 8080

# Test connectivity from client
ping server_ip
```

## 📁 What to Copy to Client Machines

**Minimum required files:**
1. `model_architecture.py`
2. `config.py` (edited with correct SERVER_IP and CLIENT_DATA_DIR)
3. `fl_client.py`
4. `requirements.txt` (optional, for installing dependencies)

**Do NOT copy:**
- `dataset/` folder (clients should have their own data)
- `fl_server.py` (only needed on server)
- `models/` folder (only on server)

---

## ✅ Pre-Flight Checklist

Before starting training:

**Server:**
- [ ] config.py has correct SERVER_IP
- [ ] Dataset is in dataset/Training and dataset/Testing
- [ ] Port 8080 is open (firewall)
- [ ] Server script is ready: `python fl_server.py`

**Each Client:**
- [ ] Copied model_architecture.py, config.py, fl_client.py
- [ ] config.py has correct SERVER_IP and CLIENT_DATA_DIR
- [ ] Dataset is placed in CLIENT_DATA_DIR
- [ ] Can ping server: `ping server_ip`
- [ ] Ready to run: `python fl_client.py client_X`

**Network:**
- [ ] All machines on same network
- [ ] Firewall allows connections on port 8080
- [ ] Tested connectivity between machines

## 🎓 Understanding the Architecture

**Traditional ML (Centralized):**
```
All data → Single machine → Train model → Deploy
```

**Federated Learning:**
```
Data stays on clients → Models train locally → 
Weights aggregated on server → Global model improves
```

**Key Differences:**
- **Privacy**: Data never leaves client machines
- **Scalability**: Can add more clients
- **Communication**: Network overhead between rounds
- **Training Time**: Slower due to network + multiple machines
